<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
    <p>XMPP components are used for long through &xep0114;, but are quite limited: they have a restricted access to other entities data, similar to what a client can do. This is sufficient for components like gateways, but very limiting for more complex components like a PubSub service. The goal of this XEP is to allow a component to have a "privileged" status, and access an entity data with the same privileges than the entity itself, that means send and receive IQ stanzas on its behalf.</p>
    <p>Privileged component have numerous advantages, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a step forward in decentralization: it is possible for a component to do tasks which were before reserved to server itself. For example, a privileged pubsub component can offer roster access model</li>
            <li>better integration of component: a gateway can add items to an entity roster itslef</li>
            <li>possibility to overpass a server limitation</li>
            <li>quick development cycle: developers can implement the component they need without waiting for a new server release</li>
            <li>server agnostic</li>
        </ul>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
    <p>A privileged component can be used in two modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>admin</strong> mode, where it is installed by the server administrator</li>
            <li><strong>client</strong> mode, where it can be installed by any user</li>
        </ul>
    <p>In <em>admin</em> mode, the component SHOULD be able to emit IQ stanzas in the same way as any entity, including managing roster or accessing persistent storage</p>
    <p>In <em>client</em> mode, a component MUST have an explicit autorization for any IQ namespace he wants to use. Client MUST be able to check and revoke granted permssions.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Glossary' anchor='glossary'>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Component</strong> — the privileged component.</li>
    <li><strong>Client</strong> — the entity that the component wants to manage.</li>

    <section2 topic='Permission Request Use Case' anchor='admin_perm'>
        <section3 topic='Component request privileged status of admin' anchor='req_status'>
            <p>Once the component is authentified and stream is started as explained in <strong>XEP-0114</strong>, the component can request its privileged status. It do it by sending an IQ stanza with <strong>'urn:xmpp:tmp:privilege:0'</strong> namespace</p>
            <example caption='Component asks for admin privilege'><![CDATA[
<iq from='pubsub.capulet.net' type='get' id='privilege1'>

</iq>
            ]]></example>
        </section3>
        <section3 topic='Server Accept Admin Privilege' anchor='accept_status'>
            <p>If the server accept the privileged status (e.g.: admin status specified in configuration), it MUST return empty IQ result stanza:</p>
            <example caption='Server accept admin privilege'><![CDATA[
<iq from='capulet.net' to='pubsub.capulet.net' type='result' id='privilege1' />
            ]]></example>
        </section3>
        <section3 topic='Server Reject Admin Privilege' anchor='reject_status'>
            <p>If the server reject the privileged status, it MUST return a &forbidden; error:</p>
            <example caption='Server reject admin privilege'><![CDATA[
<iq from='capulet.net' to='pubsub.capulet.net' type='error' id='privilege1'>
    <error type='cancel'>
        <forbidden xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'/>
    </error>

            ]]></example>
        </section3>
    </section2>

    <section2 topic='Privileged Component Send IQ Stanzas' anchor='priv_iq_admin'>
        <p>Sending an IQ stanzas is done by remplacing the &IQ; with a &lt;privilege/&gt; element of namespace <strong>'urn:xmpp:tmp:privilege:0'</strong>, and including it in a global IQ stanza. The &lt;privilege/&gt; element is then similar to the IQ stanza the client would have sent. In the following example, the PubSub service want to know juliet's roster because she own a node with roster access model:</p>
            <example caption='Privileged Component Send A Roster Stanza'><![CDATA[
<iq from='pubsub.capulet.net' type='get' id='roster1'>
    <privilege xmlns='urn:xmpp:tmp:privilege:0'
        from='juliet@example.com'
        type='get'>
        <query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'/>
    </privilege>
</iq>
            ]]></example>

        <p>The server then answer normaly, as it would have done with the client entity:</p>
            <example caption='Server Answer To Privileged Component'><![CDATA[
<iq id='roster1'
    to='pubsub.caputet.net'
    type='result'>
    <query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster' ver='ver7'>
        <item jid='nurse@example.com'/>
        <item jid='romeo@example.net'/>
    </query>
</iq>
            ]]></example>

        <p>In the following example, the sync.capulet.net privileged component want to access client's bookmarks to synchronize them with an online service. It can request the bookmarks in the following way:</p>
            <example caption='Privileged Component Request Bookmarks'><![CDATA[
<iq from='pubsub.capulet.net' type='get' id='bookmark1'>
    <privilege xmlns='urn:xmpp:tmp:privilege:0'

        </pubsub>
    </privilege>
</iq>
            ]]></example>
        <p>and server answer:</p>

<section1 topic='Client Mode Use Cases' anchor='client_usecases'>
    <section2 topic='Permission Request Use Case' anchor='client_perm'>
        <p>In <em>client</em> mode, the component is not certified by the server administrator, so the permissions MUST be <strong>explicitly</strong> allowed by the client. This is initiated by the component (it can be after an interaction with a client, like a subscription). It's done in a the same way as for <em>admin</em> mode with the following exceptions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the privilege type is <em>client</em> instead of <em>admin</em></li>
            <li>the privilege is done per entity, so the entity MUST be specified in a 'to' attribute</li>
            <li>permission are explicitly asked for every needed namespace</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Namespace permission are asked with a &lt;perm/&gt; element, which MUST contain a 'xmlns' attribute and a 'type' attribute which can be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>get</strong> — the component wants to send &IQ; stanza of type <em>'get'</em></li>
            <li><strong>set</strong> — the component wants to send &IQ; stanza of type <em>'set'</em></li>
            <li><strong>both</strong> — the component wants to send &IQ; stanza of type <em>'get'</em> and <em>'set'</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a component want a read/write access to a client's roster (juliet) and a read only access to her pubsub, it can ask the permission like this:
        </p>
            <example caption='Component Asks For User Privilege'><![CDATA[
<iq from='priv.montaigu.net' to='capulet.net' type='get' id='privilege1'>
    <query xmlns='urn:xmpp:tmp:privilege:0'
           type='request'
           privilege='client'
           to='juliet@capulet.net'>
        <perm xmlns='jabber:iq:roster' type='both'/>
        <perm xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub' type='get'/>
    </query>
</iq>
]]></example>
<p>Once received the permission request, the server ask to the client if it grant access to the requested permission using &xep0004;. The form SHOULD allow to fine tune the granted permissions. The server use a challenge which it MUST have generated himself.

<p>Here juliet accept that <em>priv.montaigu.net</em> use 'set' and 'get' to manage her roster, but doesn't want it to do any 'get' on her pubsub nodes.</p>
<p>Finaly, the server notify the component of the permission granted. For this it use a &QUERY; element with the 'allowed' type, and put the client jid in a 'from' attribute:</p>
            <example caption='Server notify accepted permissions'><![CDATA[
